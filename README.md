# Plant Disease Identifier

A web application that helps users identify plant diseases and issues by uploading photos of their plants. The application uses Gemini Vision LLM to analyze images and automatically detect diseases, pests, health issues, and provide personalized treatment recommendations. Users can view all their analyzed plants on a dashboard and export analysis details as Markdown.

## Database Schema

### High-Level Tables

**plants**
- Purpose: Store plant profiles with complete analysis results
- Essential fields: identifier, user reference, image path, disease, pests, health_issues, recommendations, timestamps
- Note: Each plant has one analysis (from the uploaded image). Analysis data is stored directly in the plants table.

**Note:** Specific field names and data types are designed by developers. SQLite stores all plant metadata and analysis results.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- UV Package Manager
- Node.js 18+
- Google API Key (for Gemini Vision LLM)
- Firebase project (for authentication)

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to Backend directory
2. Create virtual environment: `uv venv`
3. Activate virtual environment
4. Install dependencies: `uv add -r requirements.txt`
5. Create `.env` file with:
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
   ```
6. Run server: `uvicorn main:app --reload`

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to Frontend directory
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Create `.env` file with Firebase configuration
4. Run dev server: `npm run dev`

### Development Workflow

1. Start backend server (port 8000)
2. Start frontend dev server (port 5173)
3. Open browser to http://localhost:5173
4. Follow issues sequentially from issue-01 to issue-14

## Key Concepts

### Vision LLM Analysis
- Images are uploaded and sent to Gemini Vision LLM
- LLM analyzes the image and provides structured output:
  - Disease identification
  - Pest detection (yes/no and details)
  - Health issues identification
  - Personalized treatment recommendations
- Analysis results are stored directly in the database
- No specialized image classification models or OCR libraries needed

### Image Processing Pipeline
1. User uploads image (via file selection or camera)
2. Image is sent to backend
3. Image is saved to file system
4. Image is analyzed with Gemini Vision LLM
5. LLM returns structured analysis (disease, pests, health issues, recommendations)
6. Plant profile is automatically created and saved to database
7. User sees new plant card on dashboard

### Plant Profile Structure
- One image = one plant = one analysis
- Each plant profile contains:
  - Image reference
  - Disease identification
  - Pest information
  - Health issues
  - Treatment recommendations array
  - Timestamps
